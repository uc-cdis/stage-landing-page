    <p>The DataSTAGE <a href='https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/data-storage-toolspace-access-and-analytics-big-data-empowerment-data-stage'>(Storage, Toolspace, Access and analytics for biG data Empowerment)</a> project aims to create a community of practice that is motivated to collaboratively solve technical challenges to enable NHLBI investigators to find, access, share, store, cross-link, and compute on large-scale data sets. Though the primary goal of the DataSTAGE Consortium is to build a data science platform, at its core this is a people-centric endeavor.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>The relationship between DataSTAGE and the Data Commons Pilot Phase Consortium (DCPPC) is quite straightforward:</p>
    <br />
    <p>DataSTAGE is meant to be one (early) instance of the Data Commons, particularized for the purposes of NHLBI. These are two separate, but related projects, meant to be mutually beneficial.</p>
    <br />
    <p>There are expectations that the DCPPC and DataSTAGE will each cross-inform the other project of significant processes, emerging standards, and decisions using an RFC process.</p>
    <br />
    <p>This should permit loose coupling, and yet parallel progress, in order to reap the benefits of both of these two efforts.</p>
